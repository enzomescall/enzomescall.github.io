  <section id="about">
    <h1>Hey, I'm Enzo Mescall...</h1>
    <p>...a Brazilian computer scientist and statistician at Duke University. </p>
    I have a few different professional interests: data science, web development, and mathematical modelling.
    I am fluent in Python, R, Java, and SQL and I have experience with C, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and assembly languages.
    I daily-drive a Linux machine, hopping from distro to distro, and I currently find myself using System76's PopOS.
    Recently I've been interested in the skills behind product management and have enrolled in a course on the subject,
    as in ten years I see myself in a product leadership position where that knowledge will be very useful. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Beyond that, I am a big fan of basketball and Formula 1
    <br>
    <br>
    I've always wanted to have my own website and I am constantly developing this one, day by day.
    Come back in a week or two and you'll see a lot of changes!
